# TarotMoji

> Your Tarot, but with Emoji!

A NativeScript-Vue app exported from the [NativeScript Playground](http://play.nativescript.org)

## Features

This app was built for the NativeScript Uplabs challenge, and was designed by Lester Gonzales. The app was designed to be run in the Playground, so plugins have a special path and are included in the app root, rather than being installed via NPM.

You can run this app in a NativeScript Playground mobile app by navigating to the app root folder on your local computer and typing:

`tns preview ios --bundle`

or

`tns preview android --bundle`

A QR code will appear which you can scan to run the app on your phone.

If you'd like to run this app as a standard NativeScript app using the CLI, you will need to install the referenced plugins and change the paths where they are imported.
